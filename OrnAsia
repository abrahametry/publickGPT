Abstract
Ornaments have long been cherished by women throughout history. Both men and women across the globe use ornaments extensively and with joy. However, many people, especially foreigners visiting Asian countries, struggle to identify the names and categories of specific ornaments. To address this issue, an automated system is essential, particularly for supermarkets, to assist customers in recognizing ornament categories. This article presents a dataset of 1,220 images featuring six types of Asian ornaments, designed to aid researchers in ornament classification and identification. While machine and deep learning systems currently face challenges during training due to issues like low contrast and image quality, this article introduces a new dataset of six popular Asian ornaments collected from remote areas of Bangladesh, where they are highly favoured by the Bengali community. The dataset includes images of Bengals, Rings, Earrings, Tikka, Necklaces, and Payel, captured from both remote areas and local markets. By incorporating samples from various locations, the dataset aims to enhance diversity and improve the robustness of the classification models.

Specific subject area	Computer Vision, Image Processing, and Image Classification.
Type of data	 Image, Processed.
Data collection	The dataset contains six types of different ornaments from one distinct district of Bangladesh, offering a rich resource for research and analysis. The images of Bengals, Rings, Earrings, Tikka, Necklaces, and Payel that make up the dataset were all taken at the nearby markets and in the remote countryside. Realme Narzo 20 pro and Realme Narzo 50 were used to take pictures. The images are taken at ambient temperatures between 25°C and 28°C to preserve their originality and hue. We took pictures of the ornaments from several perspectives to accurately depict the real-world situation. 1220 images compose the collection; each image's lighting and angle are adjusted to precisely capture the distinctive qualities of each ornament.
Data source location	The data was collected from Mirpur, Dhaka. Mirpur is a well-known area located in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. Here are the approximate coordinates and latitude of Mirpur, Dhaka.
 Latitude: 23.8103° N
Longitude: 90.4125° E
All the images were taken from some specific area of Mirpur including Mirpur-1, Mirpur-10 and Mirpur-11.

BACKGROUND
The objective of gathering the dataset was to address the gap in ornaments identification systems for local ornaments in Bangladesh and Asia. The dataset contains six types of different ornaments from one distinct district of Bangladesh including Bengals, Rings, Earrings, Tikka, Necklaces, and Payel. These ornaments are rarely available in the world ornaments classification database, and researchers frequently encounter them. The researcher can utilise this data to encourage people to use their favourite ornaments.  Another objective of preparing the dataset is to fulfil the substantial need for feature engineering and classification algorithms in computer vision and machine learning contexts [1]. This dataset aims to improve ornaments classification performance, particularly in art and design fields, by providing diverse and high-quality images for utilising machine and deep learning algorithms[2, 3]. It also facilitates the evaluation of model performance across different architectures, like MobileNet, VGG-19, and Inception-V3. Moreover, this dataset complements existing research articles by enabling a comprehensive analysis of Asian ornament classification, which could lead to practical applications like automated sorting systems and real-time identification tools.
DATA DESCRIPTION
The dataset in this study includes a comprehensive collection of images featuring six different types of ornaments of Asia. Those ornaments have some common names in Bengali. Table 1 depicts the classification of ornaments data saved in the data repository. The total training images are 1220. The total number of training and testing images are 978 and 242, respectively.

Figure 3 shows the graphical representation of our data distribution. The number of images for each type of ornament is collected in unequal quantities. Earring images are the most abundant, with 275 in total, while Payel images are the fewest, with only 130. The number of images for other ornaments falls in between, around 200.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, MATERIALS AND METHODS
The dataset comprises 1,220 images of Asian ornaments collected from various offline sources, shops, and private collections. The images were curated to represent six distinct classes: Necklaces, Tikka, Earrings, Rings, Bangles, and Payel. The collection process ensured a diverse representation of styles and designs, encompassing both traditional and contemporary ornamentations. Each image was manually collected with its corresponding class by a team of experts familiar with Asian jewellery to ensure accurate categorization. The annotations were verified through multiple rounds of cross-checking to minimize errors and improve dataset reliability[4]. Several state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were selected for the classification task, including DensNet-201, ResNet-50, VGG-16, InceptionV3, and VGG-19 [5]. The figure 6 shows how the dataset was processed for six of the ornaments: Necklaces, Tikka, Earrings, Rings, Bangles, and Payel. The image link essentially selects different types of ornaments to form the initial sample set. Smartphone cameras took ornament images. The dataset contains 1220 images in total, out of which 976 are separated for training. This workflow is designed to efficiently categorize the dataset and use it as a foundation for further analysis or machine learning applications [6].
